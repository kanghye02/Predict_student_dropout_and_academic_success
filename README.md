Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success: Project Overview

Created a tool to estimate the risk of dropout and failure based on academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors, helping to provide more accurate help to students by deploying multiple machine learning classification methods and deep learning
Increased the accuracy from 0.78 (Random Forest Algorithm) to 0.92 by implementing efficient feature engineer (eliminating outliers and deleting repeating features) 

Code and Resources Used:
Python Version: 3.10
Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow, keras, tensorboard
